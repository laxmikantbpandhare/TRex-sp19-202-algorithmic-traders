## Project Name
### T-Rex

## Project Description
Dinosaur, T-Rex is out in the wild and running around. He got some life intially which might get drained out when he hits some obstacles. He can also gain rewards and food by catching them. User can track his score and life based on the obstacles crossed and rewards collected. There are two levels in the game which user can cross based on the score. User wins the game at score of 200 and has the option to replay the game.

### Individual Contributions

**Busi Pallavi Reddy** 

1. Brainstormed with team members for the user stories and game features for the T-Rex game.
2. Implemented the feature of making the dinosaur run, by making the GIF as multiple frames and made the obstacles move. 
3. Implemented Composite Pattern to set up the different Obstacles(Sky and Land) and Rewards(Coins and Food) in the game.
4. Worked with Suyash to set up the composite pattern based on the different levels.
5. Performed integration tests for composite and strategy pattern for different levels.
6. Added sounds for coins and losing life for dinosaur.
7. Contributed to drafting Use cases.
8. Drafted the Activity diagram for the T-Rex Game.
9. Performed end to end testing and made cosmetic changes.
10. Helped in creating the Ad video.
11. As a champion of XP value **"Respect"**, I made sure that all the team member's suggestions were entertained and a proper discussion was held for each of the team member's inputs. I made sure that every person was valued as a team member.

**Prachi Chouksey** 

1. Created user stories in the task sheet for the T-Rex game.
2. Created initial world for the game with basic actors.
3. Implemented Observer pattern in scoreboard and lifebar to update values when collision of dinosaur occurs with obstacles and rewards.
4. Performed unit testing for the observer pattern.
5. Implemented Game Over screen when the dinosaur loses all life.
6. Performed unit testing for game over feature.
7. Updated task sheet with the contribution hours in the task sheet.
8. Created use case specification document for the user stories.
9. Created class diagram and sequence diagram for observer pattern.
10. Contributed with Pallavi in creating Activity diagram.
11. As a champion of XP value **"Feedback"**, I gave timely suggestions and feedback to the team regarding patterns and use cases for the game.

**Laxmikant Pandhare** 

1. We started with initial meeting with the team. We discussed requirements and the way through which we are going to develop the application.
2. Did brainsorming with the colleagues and discussed different aspects and user stories.
3. Initially added life image on the game and thought of implementing it. But, After long discussion we finalized the progress bar and going to reduce it once Dinosaur looses.
4. Implemented Command Pattern to show the options and user will able to operate. The Client will select the operation and it will act accordingly.
5. Performed unit testing for the command pattern.
6. Created class diagram and sequence diagram for command pattern.
7. Helped in creating the Ad video.
8. Updated burndown chart according to worked hours.
9. Performed end to end testing and made cosmetic changes.
10. As part of XP value **"Courage"**, encouraged the team to discuss in case if they are facing any issues on the game implementation. So that, it will not impact on the sprint outcome.

**Wamique Ansari**

1. Our team met in the library to had an initial project discussion. We had discussions and compared various platforms like greenfoot and processing that we could use to develop our project . We decided to use greenfoot for our project to develop the game T-Rex. Discussed various features, use cases and patterns that needs to be implemented in the project.
2. To start with, added some of the actors needed for our T-Rex project and did some activities on these actors and explored more on greenfoot.
3. Explored prototype pattern and various ways to implement it, applied the same in a very simple way to get clone of some actors needed instead of creating from scratch.
4. Performed unit testing for the Prototype pattern for some actors and did knowledge transfer to the team members so that anyone can create clone of the objects needed in the same way.
5. After Pallavi was done with implementing the composite pattern, I added land, sky obstacles and rewards to the world relative to dinosaur movement to get the basic game working so that other team members can start working on other features.
6. Added the collision feature and get the actor with which the dinosaur is collided. Accordingly, other team members will add observers pattern for life and score. In case of collision, removing the obstacles and rewards. Did basic testing around the same to give a go ahead to the team. This was done as part of the user story "As a player, I want to collect rewards".
7. Added shaking effect to the dinosaur when it collides with the obstacles to make player more aware that the dinosaur is loosing life.
8. Needed to work on the game info screen to display after the game completes or the level changes. As there were many class's objects involved in implementing this feature, the classes were getting tight coupled. Explored various patterns in which this can be avoided. Figured out that mediator pattern could be applied to maintain loose coupling between the classes. Studied and explored mediator pattern and applied the same to implement this feature. This was done as part of the user story "As a player, I want to see level change screen".
9. After final integration, perform testing to check that new features are working fine and no existing functionalies are broken.
10. Created class diagram for the mediator pattern and sequence diagram for the user story "As a player, I want to collect rewards". Worked with the team to update project journal and ad Video.
11. As part of the XP value **"Simplicity"**, I ensured that things are kept simple and at the same time progress is made. Also, tasks discussed should be only done, nothing extra. Then we will move step by step further to achieve the same goal.

**Suyash Srivastava**
1. Brainstormed game ideas with team and finally zeroed in on Trex game.
2. Explored greenfoot framework and discussed patterns involved in the game with the team.
3. Worked on the dinosaur jump feature.
4. Worked on strategy pattern to implement game levels.
5. Pair programmed with Pallavi to define obstacles location and rewards location for all the levels.
6. Discussed with teammates to define game quit scenario.
7. Performed through testing of game.
8. Created the class and sequence diagram of strategy pattern.
9. Worked on video add developmemt.
10. As a part of XP value **"Communication"**, I ensured that the team meets for discussions at regular intervals and also interacts on slack
