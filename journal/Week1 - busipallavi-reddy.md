# Week 1



### What tasks did I work on / complete?

* Worked with team members to decide on what use case we are going to pick as our team project. Talked about the various platforms - Green Foot and Processing.
* Explored the various game ideas like "T-Rex", "Road Fighter", "Sequence", "Flappy Bird". Discusses broadly the use cases of each.
* Finalized the T-Rex Game.
* Brainstormed with team members for the user stories and game features.
* Discussed about the design patterns that would cater the various requirements of the user stories.
* Picked up the scrum value of "RESPECT", to ensure that each team member is respected for the efforts that they put into the project.
* Explored the Green Foot tool.
* As a part of creating the world, figured out how to add GIFs. Added the T-Rex dinosaur to the world.



### What am I planning to work on next?

* Setting up the composite pattern for the objects to be added to the world.

  

### What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member or any blockers I faced?

* For the first week, there was no blocked tasks on anyone. 
* I faced a challenge on making the GIF work. Turns out that using the GIFImage class of greenfoot for a GIF, the transparent running GIF was getting overlapped and the dinosaur looked as if it had many legs. To overcome this, then I split the GIF to its individual frames and loaded the images to give the feeling of a GIF.
