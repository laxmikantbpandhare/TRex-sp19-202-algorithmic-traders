### What tasks did I work on / complete?

1. Tried to explore greenfoot by going through various documentations and tutorials. Started to get hands on by adding actors to the greenfoot world and performing various activities on these actors, learned how to work with image scalings etc.
2. Added some of the actors needed for our T-Rex world project and did some activities on these actors.
3. Tried understanding prototype pattern and various type to implement it, applied the same in a very simple way to get clone of some actors needed instead of creating from scratch.

As part of Simplicity, we started to first get basic things worked by applying the greenfoot concepts to make actors perform so that we have a simple working model and then we will enhance by adding design patterns and more logics.

### What am I planning to work on next?

1. To add land obstacles, sky obstacles and rewards actors to the world relative to dinosaur movement.e
