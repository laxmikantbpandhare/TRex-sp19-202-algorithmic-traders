# Week 3



### What tasks did I work on / complete?

- Worked with Suyash to setup the composite objects according to the different strategy of levels.  
- With the discussion with team mates, decided on the game over page and how levels should switch.
- Decided with team members, how the command pattern ca be implemented in play and quit scenarios.
- Integrated the code and pushed to development, with testing of levels.

### What am I planning to work on next?

- To incorporate any cosmetic changes if needed, test the team's changes and drawing UML diagrams.

  

### What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member or any blockers I faced?

- I had a blocker when I was trying to remove all the objects of a certain type from a level to switch strategies. With help from Prachi, figured out that the object making the call to remove the objects should be added to the World else World is not accessible. Fixed this issue.
