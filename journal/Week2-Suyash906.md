### What tasks did I work on / complete?
- I browsed through Greenfoot documentation and watched few videos on youtube to develop a basic understanding of the Greenfoot.
- To kickstart development, each one of the team member started working on small task like making the T-rex jump, making the objects move, etc. I worked on jumping faeture of T-rex.
- I worked on defining the levels of the game using startegy pattern. There are three levels in the game. Each one has a separate strategy in terms of Trex speed, obstacles and points gain. I have added the obsctactles and rewards on all stratgies.

### What am I planning to work on next?
- I will define the exact locations where the obstacles will be introduced so that Composite pattern could be applied to display the screen.

### What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?
