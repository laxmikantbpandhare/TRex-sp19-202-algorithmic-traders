### What tasks did I work on / complete?

1. After Pallavi was done with implementing the composite pattern, I added land, sky obstacles and rewards to the world relative to dinosaur movement to get the basic game working so that other team members can start working on other features.
2. Added the collision feature and get the actor with which the dinosaur is collided. Accordingly, other team members will add observers pattern for life and score. In case of collision, removing the obstacles and rewards.

As part of XP core value 'Simplicity', I ensured that things are kept simple and at the same time progress is made. Also, tasks discussed should be only done, nothing extra. Then we will move step by step further.

### What am I planning to work on next?

To add some effect to the dinosaur in case it collides with obstacles.

### What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?

Nothing for this week.
