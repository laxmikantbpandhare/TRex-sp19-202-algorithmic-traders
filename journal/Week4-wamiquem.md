### What tasks did I work on / complete?

1. Added shaking effect to the dinosaur when it collides with the obstacles to make player more aware that the dinosuar is loosing life.
2. Showed the game info screen to the user when the game completes or the level changes. As there were many class's objects involved in implementing this feature, the classes were getting tight coupled. Explored various patterns in which this can be avoided.
3. Figured out that mediator pattern could be applied to maintain loose coupling between the classes. Studied and explored mediator pattern and applied the same to implement this feature. This was done as part of the user story "As a player, I want to see level change screen".
4. After final integration, perform testing to check that new features are working fine and no existing functionalies are broken.
5. Create class diagram for the mediator pattern.
6. Create sequence diagram for the user story "As a player, I want to collect rewards."
7. Work with the team to create project journal and ad Video.

As part of Simplicity, we tried to keep things simple throughout the project.
