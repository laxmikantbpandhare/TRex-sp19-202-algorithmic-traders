### What tasks did I work on / complete?

1. Our team met in the library to had an initial project discussion. We had discussions and compared various platforms like greenfoot and processing that we could use to develop our project . We decided to use greenfoot for our project to develop a game.
2. Next, we had different ideas and came up with different games that can be developed and is doable using the greenfoot platform. We had different game ideas like Sequence Board Game, Flappy birds, T-Rex and Road Fighter.
3. Also, we discussed various desing patterns that could be incorporated in these games.
4. We finalized the game 'T-Rex' for our group project that would be developed in greenfoot.
5. We explored the greenfoot tool.

Moreover, every team member picked a XP value and I picked Simplicity. I would ensure that we do what is needed, but no more and we will create something we are proud of.

### What am I planning to work on next?

1. To learn more about greenfoot to implement our solution.
2. To learn about prototype design pattern. In our solution, some actors objects are supposed to be created multiple times. In such a case, we can use prototype pattern to create clone from the existing object instead of creating the object from scratch everytime using factory method pattern
